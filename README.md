# Contact-Management-System
 Contact Management System implemented using JavaScript, which allows users to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts. The system includes form validation, ensuring that each contact's name, phone number, and email are properly formatted before submission. It also provides functionality to store the contact information in localStorage, allowing the data to persist even after the browser is closed.
